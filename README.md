## Information

### You can only download the following files from our server for contents: 
Cute-Owl.jpg IAAM todayilearned 
HackingForDummies.pdf Kingfisher_pram_.pdf 

All other listed files serve only to illustrate what happens when a file does not exist in SS. 

When trying to test the SS and LS on different machines need to edit the file contained in LSInfo listingfiles directory 
putting the ip and the port of destination (SS) in front of the topic name / file upload / test, where we test the last machine 
was tamega.ist.utl.pt and LSInfo contains the port and the ip of this machine.
